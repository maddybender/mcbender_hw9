# BAIS Survey Web Form ‚Äì HW9

This project is a multi-page web form created for BAIS:3300 ‚Äì Digital Product Management. It collects information from BAIS students using HTML5, Bootstrap 5.3, and Font Awesome, and is deployed as a static site via Azure.

## ‚úÖ Form Best Practices

The form is broken into multiple pages to reduce user overwhelm and improve completion rates. Input types match the data being collected (e.g., radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns), and required fields use built-in HTML validation. Logical grouping, clear labels, and simple navigation (Start ‚Üí Next ‚Üí Finish) help streamline the user experience.

To provide clarity without clutter, tooltips are added using Font Awesome icons with hover interactions, such as next to the "My home town is" field. This approach follows best practices by offering in-context help without disrupting flow.

## ‚ôø Accessibility

The form follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. It uses semantic HTML (`<label>`, `<fieldset>`, etc.), supports full keyboard navigation, and includes appropriate color contrast. Icons used for tooltips include ARIA labels to ensure screen readers can describe their function.
